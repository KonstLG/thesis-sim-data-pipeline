# thesis-sim-data-pipeline

Automated workflow in R to clean, standardize, and visualize data generated by XPPAut.

This is a tool that was created as part of my master's thesis to aid in the computational analysis 
of a system predator-prey equations with recruitment delay. 

## Motivation 

XPPAut is a numerical tool used to analyze systems of differential equations through time series, bifurcation diagrams, and phase-plane diagrams
(see https://sites.pitt.edu/~phase/bard/bardware/xpp/xpp.html
 for more information).

Raw data output from XPPAut often contains unnecessary columns and duplicate entries, which can substantially increase file size (often exceeding 10 MB). In addition, default column naming conventions are ambiguous and poorly suited for documentation or downstream analysis.

The purpose of this script is to streamline post-processing by removing redundant data, applying clear and consistent variable names, saving a cleaned dataset, and generating publication-quality visualizations in a reproducible manner.

## Requirements
- R (Version 4.0 or higher)
- Packages: dplyr, ggplot2
